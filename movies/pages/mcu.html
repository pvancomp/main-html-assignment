        The <strong>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)</strong> is an American
        media franchise and shared universe centered on a series of superhero
        films produced by <strong>Marvel Studios</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The films are based on characters that appear in American comic books
        published by <strong>Marvel Comics</strong>. The franchise also includes
        television series, short films, digital series, and literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shared universe, much like the original
        <strong>Marvel Universe</strong> in comic books, was established by
        crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.
