    <h1>Jurassic Park</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Jurassic Park</strong>, later also referred to as
      <strong>Jurassic World</strong>, is an American science fiction media
      franchise created by Michael Crichton and centered on a disastrous attempt
      to create a theme park of cloned dinosaurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It began in 1990 when Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment bought
      the rights to Crichton's novel <strong>Jurassic Park</strong> before it
      was published. The book was successful, as was Steven Spielberg's 1993
      film adaptation.
